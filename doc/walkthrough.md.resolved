# Walkthrough: Major GUI Overhaul & AI Transparency

This document details the transition of the simulation GUI from a basic dashboard to a professional, three-panel research interface, along with significant improvements to AI decision explainability.

## 📐 1. Professional Multi-Panel Layout
The screen width has been expanded to **1800px** to accommodate three distinct functional zones:

### [NEW] Left Panel: Simulation Methodology
A permanent technical reference panel explaining the academic foundations:
- **Network (Shannon):** Dynamic datarate modelingSistem Mimarisi ve İş Akışı.
- **Energy (DVFS):** Power consumption calculation.
- **Semantic AI (LLM):** Contextual priority scoring.
- **RL Agent (PPO):** Real-time optimization logic.

### Center: Interactive Strategy Map
The simulation arena now supports:
- **Zoom & Pan:** Use the mouse wheel in the center area to zoom into specific hotspots.
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Icons and links scale according to zoom level.
- **Clipping:** Map content is strictly bounded between sidebars.

### Right Panel: Infrastructure & AI Feed
- **Granular Stats:** Detailed breakdown of offloaded tasks per Edge Node (0, 1, 2) and Cloud.
- **Node Health:** Specific health monitor for the Cloud and individual Edge servers (Stable/Busy/Overload).

## 💬 2. AI Explainability: LLM vs. PPO
We have refined the "Decision Feed" to clarify how the hybrid AI architecture works:

| Feature | Role in System | Visual Feedback Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LLM Analysis** | Contextual Meaning | *"Gecikmeye duyarlı görev, Edge öneriliyor."* |
| **AI Decision (PPO)** | Real-time Optimization | *"Edge Node-1 yük dengesi ve SNR için seçildi."* |

## 🛠️ 3. Fixed Roadmap Rendering
Resolved syntax errors in [roadmap.md](file:///c:/Users/BERAT/Desktop/task-offloading-study/doc/roadmap.md) to ensure the **Sistem Mimarisi** Mermaid diagram renders correctly for academic presentations.

## 🚀 How to Run
Execute the updated unified script:
```powershell
.\run_simulation.bat
```
- **Scroll:** Mouse wheel on the right panel.
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel on the central map.
- **Analyze:** Observe the left panel to correlate theory with real-time visuals.
