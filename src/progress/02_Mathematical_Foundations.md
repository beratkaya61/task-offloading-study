# Progress Article 02: Mathematical Foundations of the Offloading Environment

## 1. Communication Model (The Shannon Limit)
To simulate realistic wireless environments, we use the **Shannon-Hartley Theorem**. The achievable datarate ($R$) is not constant but depends on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

$$ R = B \log_2(1 + SNR) $$

In our code, $SNR$ is calculated based on:
- **Transmission Power**: 0.5W.
- **Path Loss**: $d^{-\alpha}$ where $d$ is distance and $\alpha$ is the path loss exponent.
- **Interference**: Dynamic noise generated by other active devices.

## 2. Computation Model & DVFS
Computing costs are modeled using **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)**.

**Computation Time ($T_{comp}$):**
$$ T_{comp} = \frac{C_{task}}{f} $$
Where $C$ is CPU cycles and $f$ is current frequency.

**Energy Consumption ($E_{comp}$):**
$$ E_{comp} = \kappa \cdot f^3 \cdot t $$
$\kappa$ is the effective capacitance. Notice that energy usage increases with the **cube** of the frequency, making high-speed local processing very expensive for the battery.

## 3. Queueing Theory (M/M/1)
Edge servers don't always respond instantly. If multiple devices offload at once, tasks enter a **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** queue. This introduces **Queueing Latency**, making some "close" edge servers slower than distant ones if they are overcrowded.

## 4. Why these models?
By using these formulas instead of fixed numbers, we ensure that:
1. Moving away from an Edge server *actually* slows down the simulation.
2. Having many devices in one area *actually* increases interference.
3. High-load servers *actually* create bottlenecks.
